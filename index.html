    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Hi! I’m Evie, and I make retro games.</h3>

    <p>
        I’ve been interested in programming forever, but I really found my passion when I started playing around with the Game Boy in 2019.
        I started out making very simple Pokemon romhacks, getting a feel for working with existing code and hacking it to do what I want.
        A while later I decided I wanted to get better at writing assembly and started writing <a href="https://github.com/eievui5/kdl-dx">Kirby’s Dream Land DX</a>.
        This was a project which took a little over two weeks of non-stop work, and by the end I was much more familiar with the Game Boy.
    </p>
    <p>
        After this, I worked on writing <a href="https://github.com/eievui5/evunit">tools</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ISSOtm/gb-asm-tutorial">tutorials</a> for Game Boy development, and making contributions to various projects in the GBDev community.
        I'm currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/eievui5/vuiiger-engine">game engine</a> and a complementary scripting language, <a href="https://github.com/eievui5/evscript">evscript</a>.
