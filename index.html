    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Hi! I’m Eievui, and I make Game Boy games.</h3>

    <p>
        I’ve been programming since about 2015, but I really found my passion
        for it when I started playing around with the Game Boy in 2019. I
        started out making very simple Pokemon romhacks, getting a feel for
        working with existing code and hacking it to do what I want. A while
        later I decided I wanted to get better at ASM and started working on
        Kirby’s Dream Land DX. This was a project which took a little over two
        weeks of non-stop work, and by the end I had a working version of
        Kirby’s Dream Land in full color.
    </p>
    <p>
        After working on Kirby’s Dream Land DX I began to branch out, playing
        with a few languages before settling on using Godot to make a game
        engine. I spent the next few months getting used to aspects of
        higher-level/modern development; object-oriented programming, event
        observers, GUIs, and multi-threading. After a while though, I started to
        feel like making a game for modern computers was too overwhelming, and
        returned to the Game Boy with my new experience to see if I could make
        my own engine from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
        This engine, VuiBui, first made it onto GitHub on December 23 of 2020,
        and I’ve been sporadically working on it since then. In that time I’ve
        also worked on writing tools and a few short tutorials for Game Boy
        development, as well as making a contribution or two to RGBDS, the
        community-made compiler toolchain for the Game Boy.
